A presentation for Crater Remote Conf, Feb 10th 2016.

Check out the `code` folder for the related code to each of these 5 ES6 features:

* Arrow Functions
* Object Literal Shorthand / Computed Properties
* Spread / Rest Params
* Destructuring Assignment
* Modules

And if you want to use these features now, in an environment that does not 
suppor them, check out the Babel demos in the `code` folder.
